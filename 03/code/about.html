        <h2>I like web development</h2>
        <p>
          I built my first websites with table layouts and framesets and using
          image maps for site navigation.

        <h2>I am a musician</h2>
        <p>
          I started singing when I was a small child. I have been playing the
          violin since I was five years old. Later I learned to play the piano.
          Recently I started taking cello lessons. I love it.
